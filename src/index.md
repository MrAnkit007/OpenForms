Welcome to ***Static Form***.

*Static Form* is a form builder, like Google Form, that built on JAMStack aka static website.

You could try submit some demo forms below and see what they do üç¨.

Advanced forms can do some interesting things like send to between several numbers to share load between customer services. Or send to different number based on user input like gender or location.

We also encourage you to try the [admin panel](/admin) to makes some form draft.

We also accept your form submission to be published in this platform, but you need to contact us to since this website use our resource. Or... we can help you setup your own instance of *Static Form*.
