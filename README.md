## Introduction

Static Form is a form builder that built with JAMStack.

![Static Form Demo](/docs/web.gif)

Sounds like a Google Form ripoff, but it has some advantage:

1. Hackable. Host it yourself.
2. Fast! 90+ Google Lighthouse test.
3. Zero cost on Netlify free tier.

## Demo

Static Form Demo lives [here](https://staticform21.netlify.app).

You can also access the admin test area [here](https://staticform21.netlify.app/admin).

## Quick Start

Thanks to Netlify, creating you own instance of Static Form is a one-click:

This button will tell Netlify to make a copy of Static Form in your GitHub/GitLab, build the website in their edge server and set up the CI/CD automatically. You will then receive invitation email to become your new website user.

Please visit our [documentation](https://zulvkr.github.io/staticformdocs/) for detailed information.
