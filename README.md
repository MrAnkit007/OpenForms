[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a7080df2-1a6f-4408-b74f-ad09b0e26e9f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/staticform21/deploys)

Static From is a form builder, like Google Form, that built on JAMStack technology.

On the front end side we use Eleventy static site generator, Netlify CMS for the admin panel, and Tailwind CSS.

No complicated build tools, just using PostCSS CLI and Eleventy. HTML and JS minifier are included in Eleventy build process.

On the back end, well there is no back end. Static Form is configured to work with WhatsApp API and Netlify Form as endpoint out-of-the-box so you don't really have to bake your own API endpoint. Netlify will automatically re-build the website when git repo updated.
