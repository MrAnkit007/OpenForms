Static Form is a form builder, like Google Form, that built on JAMStack aka static website.

Sounds like a google form ripoff, but it has some benefits:

1. Hackable front end - both on admin and user side -, hackable form API end point, hackable data processing.
2. Fast! Near 100 Google Lighthouse test.
3. Zero cost, but you probably waste your time due to hacking happy

On the front end side it uses Eleventy static site generator, Netlify CMS for the admin panel, and Tailwind CSS.

No complicated build tools, just using PostCSS CLI and Eleventy. HTML and JS minifier are included in Eleventy build process.

On the back end, well.. There is no back end.

Actually netlify provide the back end, which is the static site hosting, form API end point and authentication.

Static Form is configured to work with WhatsApp API and Netlify Form as endpoint so you don't really have to bake your own API endpoint.
